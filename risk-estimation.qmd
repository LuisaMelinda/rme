## Risk Estimation and Prediction

Logistic regression is a method for estimating and predicting the risk of a binary event (such as disease/healthy) using one or more predictors.

You have already seen methods for the case when there is one predictor that is also binary (such as exposure/non-exposure).

We will first look at this again, with a special focus on risk ratios and odds ratios, which are important concepts for interpreting logistic regression.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
oc_mi = tribble(
  ~OC, ~MI, ~Total,
  "OC use", 13, 5000,
  "No OC use", 7, 10000
) |> 
  mutate(`No MI` = Total - MI)

totals = oc_mi |> summarize(across(c(MI, `No MI`, Total), sum)) |> 
  mutate(OC = "Total")
oc_mi = bind_rows(oc_mi, totals)
```

         | MI | No MI | Total
----------|----|-------|------
OC use.   | 13
No OC use |
