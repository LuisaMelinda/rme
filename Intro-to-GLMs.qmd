## Introduction to Epi 204 {.scrollable}

Welcome to Epidemiology 204: Quantitative Epidemiology III (Statistical Models).

In this course, we will start where Epi 203 left off: with linear regression models.

::: callout-note
Epi 203/STA 130B/STA 131B is a prerequisite for this course. If you haven't passed one of these courses, please talk to me after class.

### What you should know {.scrollable}

Epi 202: probability models for different data types

-   binomial
-   Poisson
-   Gaussian
-   exponential

Epi 203: inference for one or several homogenous populations

* the maximum likelihood inference framework:
    + likelihood functions
    + log-likelihood functions
    + score functions
    + estimating equations
    + information matrices
    + point estimates
    + standard errors
    + confidence intervals
    + hypothesis tests
    + p-values
* Hypothesis tests for one, two, and >2 groups:
    + t-tests/ANOVA for Gaussian models
    + chi-square tests for binomial and Poisson models
* Some linear regression

Stat 108: linear regression models

* building models for Gaussian outcomes
    + multiple predictors
    + interactions
* regression diagnostics
* fundamentals of R programming; e.g.:     
    + @r4ds
    + @dalgaardintroductory
* [RMarkdown or Quarto for formatting homework](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto)
    + LaTeX for writing math in RMarkdown/Quarto

### What we will cover in this course

* Linear (Gaussian) regression models (review and more details)

* Regression models for non-Gaussian outcomes
    +   binary
    +   count
    +   time to event

* Statistical analysis using R

## Regression models

Why do we need them?

*   continuous predictors

*   not enough data to analyze some subgroups individually

### Example: Adelie penguins

```{r}
#| label: fig-palmer-1
#| fig-cap: Palmer penguins
#| echo: false

library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)
ggpenguins <- 
  palmerpenguins::penguins |> 
  dplyr::filter(species == "Adelie") |> 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = bill_length_mm , y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point() + 
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") + 
  ylab("Body mass (g)")

print(ggpenguins)
```

### Linear regression

```{r}
#| label: fig-palmer-2
#| fig-cap: Palmer penguins with linear regression fit
ggpenguins2 = 
  ggpenguins +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm",
              formula = y ~ x,
              geom = "smooth")

ggpenguins2 |> print()

```

### Curved regression lines

```{r}
#| label: fig-palmer-3
#| fig-cap: Palmer penguins - curved regression lines
ggpenguins2 = ggpenguins +
  stat_smooth(
    method = "lm",
    formula = y ~ log(x),
    geom = "smooth") +
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") + 
  ylab("Body mass (g)")
ggpenguins2
```

### Multiple regression

```{r}
#| label: fig-palmer-4
#| fig-cap: "Palmer penguins - multiple groups"

ggpenguins =
  palmerpenguins::penguins |> 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = bill_length_mm , 
        y = body_mass_g,
        color = species
    )
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(
    method = "lm",
    formula = y ~ x,
    geom = "smooth") +
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") + 
  ylab("Body mass (g)")
ggpenguins |> print()

```

### Modeling non-Gaussian outcomes

```{r}
#| label: fig-beetles_1a
#| fig-cap: "Mortality rates of adult flour beetles after five hours' exposure to gaseous carbon disulphide (Bliss 1935)"

library(glmx)
data(BeetleMortality)
beetles = BeetleMortality |>
  mutate(
    pct = died/n,
    survived = n - died
  )

plot1 = 
  beetles |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = dose, y = pct)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = n)) +
  xlab("Dose (log mg/L)") +
  ylab("Mortality rate (%)") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  # xlab(bquote(log[10]), bquote(CS[2])) +
  scale_size(range = c(1,2))

print(plot1)
```

### Why don't we use linear regression?

```{r}
#| label: fig-beetles-plot1
#| fig-cap: "Mortality rates of adult flour beetles after five hours' exposure to gaseous carbon disulphide (Bliss 1935)"
beetles_long = 
  beetles  |> 
  reframe(.by = everything(),
          outcome = c(
            rep(1, times = died), 
            rep(0, times = survived))
  )

lm1 = 
  beetles_long |> 
  lm(
    formula = outcome ~ dose, 
    data = _)


range1 = range(beetles$dose) + c(-.2, .2)

f.linear = function(x) predict(lm1, newdata = data.frame(dose = x))

plot2 = 
  plot1 + 
  geom_function(fun = f.linear, aes(col = "Straight line")) +
  labs(colour="Model", size = "")
print(plot2)
```

### Zoom out

```{r}
#| label: fig-beetles2
#| fig-cap: Mortality rates of adult flour beetles after five hours' exposure to gaseous carbon disulphide (Bliss 1935)
#| echo: false
print(plot2 + expand_limits(x = c(1.6, 2)))
```

### log transformation of dose?

```{r}
#| label: fig-beetles3
#| fig-cap: Mortality rates of adult flour beetles after five hours' exposure to gaseous carbon disulphide (Bliss 1935)


lm2 = 
  beetles_long |> 
  lm(formula = outcome ~ log(dose), data = _)

f.linearlog = function(x) predict(lm2, newdata = data.frame(dose = x))

plot3 = plot2 + 
  expand_limits(x = c(1.6, 2)) +
  geom_function(fun = f.linearlog, aes(col = "Log-transform dose"))

print(plot3  + expand_limits(x = c(1.6, 2)))
```


### Logistic regression

```{r}
#| label: fig-beetles4b
#| fig-cap: Mortality rates of adult flour beetles after five hours' exposure to gaseous carbon disulphide (Bliss 1935)

glm1 = beetles |> 
  glm(formula = cbind(died, survived) ~ dose, family = "binomial")

f = function(x) predict(glm1, newdata = data.frame(dose = x), type = "response")

plot4 = plot3 + geom_function(fun = f, aes(col = "Logistic regression"))
print(plot4)
```


### Three parts to regression models

-   What distribution does the outcome have for a specific subpopulation defined by covariates? (outcome model)

-   How does the combination of covariates relate to the mean? (link function)

-   How do the covariates combine? (linear predictor, interactions)

## Using these lecture notes

These lecture notes are available online at <https://d-morrison.github.io/rme/>.
The online note are searchable and are currently^[as of 2024/05/10] being iteratively updated.
A pdf version of the notes is also downloadable from <https://d-morrison.github.io/rme/Regression-Models-for-Epidemiology.pdf>,
and the source files are available at <https://github.com/d-morrison/rme>.


### Compiling chapters as lecture slide decks

Each chapter's source file can also be compiled as a lecture slide deck, using the 
[`_quarto-revealjs.yml`](https://github.com/d-morrison/rme/blob/main/_quarto-revealjs.yml) [Quarto profile](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/profiles.html).
For example, to compile @sec-Bernoulli-models as a slide deck:

1) [install quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

2) clone the project repository from [Github](https://github.com/d-morrison/rme)

3) Install the project dependencies using `devtools`:

``` r 
library(devtools) # install from CRAN if needed
devtools::install_deps()
```

4) Render the chapter using the `revealjs` profile using the following terminal shell command:

``` bash
quarto render logistic-regression.qmd --profile=revealjs
```

You can also render all the chapters listed in the [`_quarto-revealjs.yml`](https://github.com/d-morrison/rme/blob/main/_quarto-revealjs.yml) 
[Quarto profile](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/profiles.html)
as slide decks simultaneously:

``` bash
quarto render --profile=revealjs
```

### Extracting LaTeX commands from the online version of the notes

If you want to extract the LaTeX commands for any math expressions in the online lecture notes, you should be able to right-click and get this pop-up menu:

![Pop-up menu](images/latex-popup-1.png)

If you select "TeX commands", you will get a window with MathJax code, which is more or less a dialect of LaTeX:

![MathJax code window](images/latex-popup-2.png)

You can also grab the TeX commands from my quarto source files on github, but those files use my custom macros, so it's a little harder to reuse code from the source files.

### Dark Mode

The online notes have two color palette themes: light and dark.
You can toggle between them using the oval button near the top-left corner:

## Other resources

These notes represent my still-developing perspective on regression models in epidemiology. Many other statisticians and epidemiologists have published their own perspectives, and you are encouraged to explore your many options and find ones that resonate with you. I have attempted to cite my sources throughout these notes. 

Here are some additional resources:
