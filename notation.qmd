## The percent sign

The percent sign "%" is just a shorthand for "$\times \frac{1}{100}$". 
The word "percent" comes from the Latin "per centum"; "centum" means 100 in Latin, so "percent" means "per hundred" (c.f., <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage>)

So, contrary to what you may have learned previously, $10\% = 0.1$ is a true and correct equality.

:::{.proof}

$$
\ba
10\% &= 10 \times \frac{1}{100}
\\ &= \frac{10}{100}
\\ &= 0.1
\ea
$$
