These lecture notes use calculus and some linear algebra.
Some key results are listed here.

## Derivatives

:::{#thm-product-rule}
#### Product rule
$$(ab)' = ab' + ba'$$
:::

:::{#thm-quotient-rule}
#### Quotient rule
$$(a/b)' = 1/b - (a/b^2)b'$$ 
:::

:::{#thm-chain-rule}
#### Chain rule
$$\derivf{a}{c} = \derivf{a}{b} \derivf{b}{c}$$
:::

## Logarithms and Exponentials

:::{#thm-log-prod}
#### logarithm of a product is the sum of the logs of the factors
$$
\log{a\cd b} = \log{a} + \log{b}
$$

:::

:::{#cor-log-quot}
#### logarithm of a quotient

::: notes
The logarithm of a quotient is equal to the difference of the logs of the factors:
:::

$$\log{\frac{a}{b}} = \log{a} - \log{b}$$
:::

:::{#thm-log-exp}
#### logarithm of an exponential function
$$
\log{a^b} = b \cd \log{a}
$$

:::

:::{#thm-exp-sum}
#### exponential of a sum

::: notes
The exponential of a sum is equal to the product of the exponentials of the addends:
:::

$$\exp{a+b} = \exp{a} \cd \exp{b}$$

:::

:::{#thm-deriv-log}

#### derivative of logarithm
$$\dlogf{x} = \frac{1}{x} = x^{-1}$$
:::

:::{#thm-deriv-exp}
#### derivative of exponential
$$\dexpf{x} = \expf{x}$$
:::

---

:::{#cor-deriv-log-chain}

#### Chain rule for logarithms
$$
\deriv{x}\log{f(x)} = \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}
$$

:::

::: proof
Apply @thm-chain-rule and @thm-deriv-log.
