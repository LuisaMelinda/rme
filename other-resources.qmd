- @dunn2018generalized is a recent textbook on GLMs. It doesn't cover time-to-event models, and it doesn't use the modern [`tidyverse`](https://tidyverse.org/) packages ([`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), etc.), but otherwise it seems great.

- @moore2016applied is a recent textbook on survival analysis. It also doesn't use the `tidyverse`, but otherwise seems great.

- @rms2e is a popular textbook. It uses [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) but not [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), 
and covers GLMs and survival analysis. 
An abbreviated but continuously updated version with audio clips is available at <https://hbiostat.org/rmsc/>.

- @fox2015applied is another standard text.

- <https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat504/book/> provides course notes for
